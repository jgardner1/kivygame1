This is a simple game made using Kivy.

Running
-------

See http://kivy.org/docs/installation/installation-windows.html for how to
install kivy on windows. Choose one of the methods for running the .py file.

Note that I use the "sent to" method, but you should be able to use the
pylauncher method because I put the first line in as #!/usr/bin/kivy
